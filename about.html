                <h2 class="bio-heading">Zach Butler: Founder</h2>
                <p class="bio-text">While teaching English and media studies at the University of Montevallo, Zach got the filmmaking itch and packed everything he owned into a tiny Ford Hatchback and moved to Hollywood.</p>

                <p class="bio-text">After working as a documentary filmmaker, commercial editor, and social media producer, he got pulled back into education - this time as an Instructional Media Producer for Cornell's Center for Teaching Innovation.</p>

                <p class="bio-text">At Cornell, he didn't just make instructional videos or promotional puff pieces. He told stories about how innovative teachers discover gaps in their students' understanding, then develop new strategies to help them reach their potential. He collaborated with faculty and instructional designers who were experimenting with technology in the classroom - and learned firsthand what actually works and what becomes just another obstacle.</p>

                <p class="bio-text">But most EdTech marketing doesn't speak that language. It's full of buzzwords and feature lists. It's made by people who understand technology but not teaching.</p>

                <p class="bio-text">Zach founded Lesson Zero to bridge that gap. He creates marketing videos for EdTech companies that demonstrate real solutions to real classroom problems - videos that educators actually trust. Because he brings both the filmmaker's craft and the educator's perspective.</p>

                <p class="bio-text">Now based in Laramie, Wyoming, he works with EdTech companies at every stage, from bootstrapping startups to established platforms, helping them tell the story that comes before the first lesson.</p>
